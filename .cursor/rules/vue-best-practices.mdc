- Use Vue3 Composition API for better code organization and reusability
- Components should be automatically split into multiple small components that are easy to maintain
- parseTime/parseDate/baseURL are global properties and can be used directly
- Leverage Vue's built-in directives like `v-model` for form handling
- Implement proper error handling with `try/catch` in component setup
